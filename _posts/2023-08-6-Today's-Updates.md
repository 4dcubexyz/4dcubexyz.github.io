# Today's Updates To Tesseract

Today I worked on Tesseract for a few hours. Learned a lesson about game development.

## The best game mechanic is not always the one that is "correct".

Think about it. If you're running, and then you jump, you can't turn your body and change directions.
In reality, when you jump, you keep going in the same direction, as no forces (besides gravity) are acting upon you.

By contrast, when playing Tesseract, I found it was best to allow changing direction mid air (by looking in a different direction), instead of
forcing it to keep the same direction for the whole jump. Possibly better camera movement, or an actual player body, which still needs to be added, could help?

## Ending Note
